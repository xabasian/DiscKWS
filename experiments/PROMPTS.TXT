She asked with a reportorial gleam in her eye. (SI1684)
Come on, let's hurry down before they lock up for the day. (SI1685)
It latches when you close it, so stay as long as you like. (SI1686)
Now don't shut this door. (SI1687)
Something else distracted him, yet there was no sound, only tomblike silence. (SI1688)
Then he heard the outer door closing. (SI1689)
Hey, come back, he shouted. (SI1690)
No, they could kill him just as easy right now. (SI1691)
Except for those minutes in her room, he had lost touch with her as a reality. (SI1692)
It was awkward: very awkward. (SI1693)
Someone reasonably trustworthy. (SI1694)
Anything to do with an ace o' spades, bad luck. (SI1695)
Not when she'd waited so long already. (SI1696)
It would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor. (SI1697)
So somebody else knew what would happen to her father's money if she died. (SI1698)
Well, then who brought it? (SI1699)
Take your cobbler's shop somewhere else. (SI1700)
Emotionally, they penetrated him not at all. (SI1701)
And so he walked, aimless again. (SI1702)
When he left, she knew she would never see him again. (SI1703)
You're a taxpayer, householder, landlord. (SI1704)
Got the upstairs guy, he bellows. (SI1705)
They'll tell you what's cooking. (SI1706)
For a man of his mass he was curiously short. (SI1707)
Me, he said merrily. (SI1708)
Those lovely whorls, he chortled. (SI1709)
They had come not to admire but to observe. (SI1710)
They're going to louse me up good. (SI1711)
You think somebody is going to stand up in the audience and make guilty faces? (SI1712)
He may try to phone us. (SI1713)
Here's where luck would normally step in. (SI1714)
Within this framework, what followed was strained, even macabre. (SI1715)
He drew a deep breath. (SI1716)
Lullaby and goodnight his voice shook. (SI1717)
Do you know what they think of me? (SI1718)
We've done our part. (SI1719)
They took it away, overalls or something. (SI1720)
Come home right away. (SI1721)
He drove, and the road wobbled, familiar scenes crept past on either side. (SI1722)
A new idea drifted in from nowhere. (SI1723)
They were all faded. (SI1724)
Worn through at the knees. (SI1725)
And men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms, sucking dust up once more. (SI1726)
Check the overnighters out. (SI1727)
Anybody carrying anything that might hide a rifle? (SI1728)
Shrugs met that, from room clerks, from bellhops. (SI1729)
Nobody in his right mind punishes a quarter-century-old dereliction. (SI1730)
Jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong? (SI1731)
Bitter, unreasoning jealousy? (SI1732)
He also reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities. (SI1733)
It was not, whatever tale was told by tails. (SI1734)
And possessed himself -- how? (SI1735)
The poor, unlucky -- the telephone rang. (SI1736)
Brain examined for thrombosis, clot or hemorrhage. (SI1737)
No signs of these, no gross hemorrhage of lungs, heart, brain or stomach. (SI1738)
Oh, the time of death. (SI1739)
Probably around midnight, give or take an hour either way. (SI1740)
She always did before, and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised. (SI1741)
With her sharp tongue she'd have cut his pompousness to ribbons. (SI1742)
He went on to personal bequests, a list of names largely unknown to him. (SI1743)
Old people have their idiosyncrasies. (SI1744)
This one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more. (SI1745)
His salary had reached the ten thousand mark. (SI1746)
He would offer no theory to account for her murder. (SI1747)
It's still unbelievable that it was murder. (SI1748)
Nevertheless it's true. (SI1749)
Could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared? (SI1750)
One more muddleheaded play like that one and they'd be leading him away. (SI1751)
In the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps. (SI1752)
He could pick up another pack on his way home, if he were going home. (SI1753)
He said: the crazy fool, half aloud. (SI1754)
Only then did he decide he didn't want one. (SI1755)
Meanwhile, fishermen took advantage of them to pull up whoppers. (SI1756)
His sarcasm was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and bad teeth. (SI1757)
Widow, nice sort of woman. (SI1758)
Got a heck of a buy on this, dirt cheap. (SI1759)
The wrinkled mouth laughed, revealing astonishingly strong, white, teeth. (SI1760)
Hiding out like this won't get him anything, except more trouble, or a bullet. (SI1761)
If she moved gracefully, she was clumsy at it. (SI1762)
That's your headache. (SI1763)
Soak up local color. (SI1764)
No other visitor inquired for her that evening. (SI1765)
We have better rooms vacant now, he babbled. (SI1766)
Two women, who had been chattering like parrots, were struck dumb. (SI1767)
The clerk's eyes flickered. (SI1768)
Suppose you tell me the real reason, he drawled. (SI1769)
There is no story, he piped tremulously. (SI1770)
A thick, crimson carpet muffled every footfall. (SI1771)
Hastily the boy switched on a ceiling light. (SI1772)
The room looked normal and even commonplace. (SI1773)
There was no hint of a violent struggle now. (SI1774)
The blue rug was suspiciously bright and new. (SI1775)
Afraid you'll lose your job if you don't keep your mouth shut? (SI1776)
Were you on duty here two weeks ago? (SI1777)
Women didn't use white face powder nowadays, he recalled. (SI1778)
They used pink, tan, or cream powder. (SI1779)
A monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall, distorted and indefinable. (SI1780)
The shadow vanished. (SI1781)
There was a thick, squashy crack of fist on flesh. (SI1782)
Rough cloth rasped his fist. (SI1783)
There was a grunt, curiously inarticulate, like that of an animal in pain. (SI1784)
On the bare floorboards a man lay face down. (SI1785)
The man's eyelids fluttered. (SI1786)
It's perhaps a mile from here where we sit. (SI1787)
Pretty girls among them, with blonde hair and pert faces. (SI1788)
Like his glossy black hair. (SI1789)
Oh yes, he'd talked about doing so. (SI1790)
No, the man was not drunk; he wondered how he got tied up with this stranger. (SI1791)
Why don't they tell me themselves if it bothers them? (SI1792)
This favorite grievance was not the landlord. (SI1793)
But why pay her bills? (SI1794)
He shrugged casually. (SI1795)
His eyes burned feverishly. (SI1796)
C'mon, he whispered; floor level's about three feet down, so don't fall. (SI1797)
We'll both be blowing town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you. (SI1798)
His sure-sure was enthusiastic this time. (SI1799)
To kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill. (SI1800)
If we left one we'd have to wipe it for fingerprints. (SI1801)
Our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have turned out his pockets. (SI1802)
In fact, nobody saw us, cop or citizen. (SI1803)
It had gone like clockwork. (SI1804)
How safe is too safe? (SI1805)
Shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first? (SI1806)
Self's integrity was and is and ever had been. (SI1807)
They went downstairs, loaded a tray lavishly. (SI1808)
Okay, take the tray. (SI1809)
That'll be plenty to eat by. (SI1810)
"Presently", his water brother said breathlessly. (SI1811)
Eternity is no time for recriminations. (SI1812)
You too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me. (SI1813)
Afterwards you did well enough. (SI1814)
Mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches. (SI1815)
Anyhow, it was high time the boy was salted. (SI1816)
My beloved ward, my perennial gadfly, said the whining voice. (SI1817)
Fuming, helpless, he watched them pass him. (SI1818)
He rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw. (SI1819)
A range of bluffs hugged the horizon, the color of decaying moss. (SI1820)
These planets were much bigger, nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere. (SI1821)
But to the infuriation of scientists, for no known reason not all of them did. (SI1822)
Sonic, electronic, galvanic -- all blank. (SI1823)
Positive results start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark. (SI1824)
He wasn't likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever. (SI1825)
It looks like we did, when we made blastdown. (SI1826)
Maybe it would work the other way. (SI1827)
Actually, they said, he did sleep, but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot. (SI1828)
His body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispel fatigue poisons. (SI1829)
The buddies invariably took advantage of him. (SI1830)
Behind him, his mates stirred without waking. (SI1831)
You are right now, buddy. (SI1832)
Why pick me for your patsy? (SI1833)
Why accuse a shipmate of being behind this? (SI1834)
The tapes show that. (SI1835)
There's still such a thing as mental illness. (SI1836)
Her hum became a gurgle of surprise. (SI1837)
The lady's eyes, unmagnified, bugged out. (SI1838)
You people don't have adjustable vision. (SI1839)
The good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time. (SI1840)
She found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy. (SI1841)
When she awoke, she was the ship. (SI1842)
She was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner. (SI1843)
Hello, anyone at home? (SI1844)
The sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive. (SI1845)
The many-bodied girl lay near him. (SI1846)
She radiated warmth and good fellowship. (SI1847)
We can die, too, we can die like real people. (SI1848)
He remembered them well from his happy period. (SI1849)
A good morrow to you, my boy. (SI1850)
You mean a game with cards? (SI1851)
Soon, said the half-man. (SI1852)
Thus events occurred, and victims changed in appearance, and new ones arrived. (SI1853)
He remembered the last time he had eaten -- actual eggs from an actual pan. (SI1854)
People never live forever. (SI1855)
Her eyes were glazed as if she didn't hear or even see him. (SI1856)
No girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him. (SI1857)
She drank greedily, and murmured, thank you, as he lowered her head. (SI1858)
We'll work for our keep, the boy said eagerly. (SI1859)
We're not drunkards, she said. (SI1860)
My dress needs some work on it. (SI1861)
We'll pay you back if you'll let us. (SI1862)
We haven't slept together since we started. (SI1863)
You don't hate me any more? (SI1864)
Now there's nothin left of me. (SI1865)
Thirty-five they rode at a measured pace through the valley. (SI1866)
Then at last the darkness began to dissolve. (SI1867)
They neither gained nor fell back. (SI1868)
He rode low on the mare's neck. (SI1869)
A bayonet hung in a belt scabbard. (SI1870)
The guerrilla bivouac remained silent. (SI1871)
He kissed her also, and with deep tenderness. (SI1872)
Running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock? (SI1873)
He might say or do something foolish. (SI1874)
They were tethered, army style, on stable lines. (SI1875)
A voice spoke near-at-hand. (SI1876)
There's no chance now of all of us getting away. (SI1877)
You'll have to try it alone. (SI1878)
That touched off a total stampede. (SI1879)
He picked up the powder canister and ran out. (SI1880)
Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon. (SI1881)
Guerrillas were racing toward him. (SI1882)
Some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak. (SI1883)
The wagons were burning fiercely. (SI1884)
The mudwagon had caught fire also. (SI1885)
The roof of the command post began to buckle. (SI1886)
Anything wrong, cap'n? (SI1887)
There's no war on now. (SI1888)
His legs pumped furiously, his long black hair streamed out behind him. (SI1889)
Although my shot killed his horse, he rolled off the bale on top of me. (SI1890)
His eyes were dark, fluid, fearful, and he gave a sigh as my knife went in. (SI1891)
You could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size. (SI1892)
It took him a long time to compose himself. (SI1893)
My father ran him off here six years ago. (SI1894)
It might hurt you, though. (SI1895)
And he was handsome, despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek. (SI1896)
She seemed irritated. (SI1897)
You've got no business up here. (SI1898)
You took me by surprise. (SI1899)
There would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief. (SI1900)
A warm breeze played across it, moving it like waves. (SI1901)
The pulsing glow of a cigarette. (SI1902)
When he saw me coming he turned his radio off. (SI1903)
When suitably lighted, what would it look like? (SI1904)
Meanwhile spring had passed well into summer. (SI1905)
They had chosen this night purposely. (SI1906)
Bury those uniforms so they won't be found. (SI1907)
After another long pause he asked, how many people know who they are? (SI1908)
Fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt. (SI1909)
He lived and breathed for the mining company. (SI1910)
Ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches. (SI1911)
It cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them. (SI1912)
The gunman nodded, slipping the picture into his breast pocket, saying nothing. (SI1913)
As she drove, she thought about her plan. (SI1914)
It was there that she would have to enact her renunciation, beg forgiveness. (SI1915)
Perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream. (SI1916)
Nevertheless, she continued to move upward. (SI1917)
It circled her thighs, exploring with its icy tentacles. (SI1918)
Every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy. (SI1919)
Lips pursed mournfully, he stared down at its crazily sagging left side. (SI1920)
And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance. (SI1921)
Or maybe you just don't feel like a cigar? (SI1922)
What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag? (SI1923)
Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you? (SI1924)
So what's this all about? (SI1925)
Why single me out on this permit deal? (SI1926)
You do that or take you out a permit right now. (SI1927)
Not immediately, as the deputy demanded. (SI1928)
Oil-field workers were a rough-tough lot. (SI1929)
A rabbit punch redoubled him. (SI1930)
No more could he defend himself against them. (SI1931)
Why, he's going to kill me, he thought wildly. (SI1932)
Beat me to death in front of a hundred people. (SI1933)
Wait a little while. (SI1934)
In my place, you'd follow such advice as you give me? (SI1935)
We'll ride out as soon as we've had chuck. (SI1936)
They were all good men. (SI1937)
Lighted windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour. (SI1938)
Put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked. (SI1939)
He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain. (SI1940)
We'll talk over at your office. (SI1941)
It was secured by an oversized padlock. (SI1942)
For the unseen, ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time. (SI1943)
The former scout's alibi couldn't be shaken. (SI1944)
Privately, he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin. (SI1945)
The rustling problem was by no means solved. (SI1946)
There were no tracks of either hoofs or boots. (SI1947)
He moistened his lips uneasily. (SI1948)
Who told you to do it? (SI1949)
Does this make it any easier, coward? (SI1950)
He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble. (SI1951)
We're going someplace. (SI1952)
Where're you takin' me? (SI1953)
Honey, he whispered. (SI1954)
Like enough we'll all be up on top by sundown. (SI1955)
A single kick made it spring open, shuddering. (SI1956)
Clapping spurs to the bronc, he set off at a sharp canter, with growing alarm. (SI1957)
His first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing. (SI1958)
He had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind. (SI1959)
A slug had torn half of his stirrup-guard away. (SI1960)
A second twitched his shirtsleeve, and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm. (SI1961)
Another snarled close overhead. (SI1962)
Each plane carried two five-hundred pound bombs. (SI1963)
The pilots' heads looked ridiculously small. (SI1964)
If the other pilots were worried, they did not show it. (SI1965)
Although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity. (SI1966)
Twelve o'clock level. (SI1967)
The opposing aircraft continued to come on. (SI1968)
If any of us miss, they can pick up the pieces. (SI1969)
The clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around. (SI1970)
Let's take 'em home. (SI1971)
Perfect, he thought. (SI1972)
The enemy did not veer. (SI1973)
As if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them. (SI1974)
A large piece of engine cowling vanished. (SI1975)
Wingman, stay clear, he prayed. (SI1976)
He fought the panic of vertigo. (SI1977)
Something pulled my leg. (SI1978)
We were off the road, gleaming barbed wire pulling taut. (SI1979)
High, so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car's steel roof. (SI1980)
On unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash. (SI1981)
Two cars came over a crest, their chrome and glass flashing. (SI1982)
Brakes shrieked behind us. (SI1983)
And what eyes they were. (SI1984)
Eyes like hot honey, eyes that sizzled. (SI1985)
What's your name, anyway? (SI1986)
Anyway, it was evident what he had in mind. (SI1987)
How's it strike you, foul or fair? (SI1988)
Accident, murder, suicide -- take your pick. (SI1989)
How will we work it out? (SI1990)
A lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks, and having a ball. (SI1991)
Or, more rhythmically, the swarthy witches are laughing? (SI1992)
Should she wake him? (SI1993)
So if all these beers was to get me in bed, man, you just spent a lot of money. (SI1994)
He blew his nose expertly between his fingers. (SI1995)
You shall see her at dinner. (SI1996)
Like as if it were built of books. (SI1997)
She took it grudgingly, her dark eyes baleful as they met his. (SI1998)
She asked smolderingly. (SI1999)
We can get it if we dig, he said patiently. (SI2000)
We're lost and burning up already, she bit out tensely. (SI2001)
They'll roll off in another day. (SI2002)
In a way, he couldn't blame her. (SI2003)
She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder. (SI2004)
He had left her inviolate, thinking familiarity would gentle her in time. (SI2005)
His blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead. (SI2006)
To his puzzlement, there suddenly was no haze. (SI2007)
He swung up over the wheel. (SI2008)
The clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel. (SI2009)
The cloudburst cut off abruptly. (SI2010)
At least, the wheels dug in. (SI2011)
His wife didn't give a sign she'd heard. (SI2012)
They were already swollen to bursting. (SI2013)
Sulphur, oil, and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of. (SI2014)
The lifeboats were stuck fast. (SI2015)
Heave on those ropes; the boat's come unstuck. (SI2016)
Let's hope we come to a safer place. (SI2017)
They were shattered. (SI2018)
Later, you shall know it better. (SI2019)
The old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood. (SI2020)
Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think. (SI2021)
What outfit does she drive for? (SI2022)
Nowadays, we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish. (SI2023)
They don't go for bull-like muscle, as a rule. (SI2024)
He didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself. (SI2025)
The great black leopards. (SI2026)
They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools. (SI2027)
He took his mask from his forehead and threw it, unexpectedly, across the deck. (SI2028)
A note of awe came into his voice. (SI2029)
Our boy didn't chicken out, no sir. (SI2030)
Whatever you tell him he will dive. (SI2031)
He took a big swig of his drink. (SI2032)
It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this. (SI2033)
Make it come off all right. (SI2034)
He felt a good deal less shaky. (SI2035)
As his feet slowed, he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand. (SI2036)
He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed. (SI2037)
He murmured to himself, with firmness: no surrender. (SI2038)
His superiors had also preached this, saying it was the way for eternal honor. (SI2039)
His comrades were all dead. (SI2040)
The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound. (SI2041)
You came well equipped to die. (SI2042)
Are you a thrower of flame, marine? (SI2043)
Wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an oily film. (SI2044)
Before much longer the marine quieted down. (SI2045)
He straightened up, alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer. (SI2046)
Stay right here where you are, kid, he called. (SI2047)
The kid has no manners, boys. (SI2048)
Shall we teach him some? (SI2049)
A third shot doused the light. (SI2050)
He'll shoot up the town. (SI2051)
The entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn. (SI2052)
He sized up the situation and shook his head. (SI2053)
He slipped outside, hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways. (SI2054)
Can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow. (SI2055)
All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body. (SI2056)
He strolled back to the door, whistling softly, hands still clasped behind him. (SI2057)
Why ain't you playin' ball? (SI2058)
They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap. (SI2059)
Thank you, she said, dusting herself off. (SI2060)
Maybe some other day. (SI2061)
Oh, shucks, the girl said. (SI2062)
To his surprise his plan worked perfectly. (SI2063)
He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race. (SI2064)
Lifting her skirts, she climbed in, never relinquishing her grip on his arm. (SI2065)
He saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head. (SI2066)
Yeah, seems so, don't it, the boy laughed, hugging her close. (SI2067)
We don't know this guy. (SI2068)
His head came up and he said it defiantly. (SI2069)
Come sit, he repeated, motioning to the piled hay bags, over the pig leavings. (SI2070)
Yeah, but what're we gonna eat? (SI2071)
He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners. (SI2072)
He ripped down the cellophane carefully, and laid three dogs on the tin foil. (SI2073)
How come you're riding the rods, kids like you? (SI2074)
Now forget all this other. (SI2075)
You gonna give me a drink, fella? (SI2076)
Maybe you and me will, girlie, but these two ain't goin' nowhere. (SI2077)
Or the bay of female dogs in heat. (SI2078)
They had slapped their thighs. (SI2079)
He would not carry a brief case. (SI2080)
All the while she sat there, her sinewy arms swirled before her chest. (SI2081)
You're boiling milk, ain't you? (SI2082)
Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud. (SI2083)
What about a tea room, then? (SI2084)
She was so beautiful, so valiant, so pitiable. (SI2085)
Absolution for his lie? (SI2086)
Why lacerate the -- congregation? (SI2087)
He'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been. (SI2088)
If he ever did such a thing again she'd die of shame. (SI2089)
He swung in through his own wide gateway. (SI2090)
No temptation, no virtue? (SI2091)
Go change your shoes before you turn around. (SI2092)
He then offered his own estimate of the weather, which was unenthusiastic. (SI2093)
He scowled at her flowers. (SI2094)
My dad did it, and he lived to a great age. (SI2095)
Ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man. (SI2096)
Left mine many a time, only she never knew it. (SI2097)
He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly. (SI2098)
But she suffered in her off-duty hours. (SI2099)
Then, after a while, she went to her mirror. (SI2100)
Just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didn't know. (SI2101)
He may not rise to the heights, but he can get by, and eventually be retired. (SI2102)
See you in about an hour. (SI2103)
Ahah, he thought, a lush divorcee at last. (SI2104)
It gave her a lewd, winking effect. (SI2105)
Our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics. (SI2106)
It sounded silly; why go on? (SI2107)
Don't forget whiskey; it's such a big seller. (SI2108)
She looked crestfallen, as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race. (SI2109)
With any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot. (SI2110)
But roulette's not my game. (SI2111)
He's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully. (SI2112)
How's your luck, honey? (SI2113)
Stake me, she said, and let me at those dice. (SI2114)
Named after the ballet. (SI2115)
Is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense? (SI2116)
He saw the dangers, not the glories of being identified as a mutineer. (SI2117)
There is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners. (SI2118)
The instinct of discipline has been lost. (SI2119)
He paused, then added: "Everything on a ship is a weapon." (SI2120)
Another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist. (SI2121)
Now the hope was gone. (SI2122)
This tragic lad had forged his own shackles. (SI2123)
The air smelled warmish and foul. (SI2124)
His black hat with its wide brim, high crown, and fur trim rode high. (SI2125)
One white hand poised a stick above his desk. (SI2126)
The guttural language from the ghetto stopped. (SI2127)
Some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the words long ago. (SI2128)
His body pitched back and forth on the bench. (SI2129)
Does this bother you? (SI2130)
You had to be stupid or crazy or immortal. (SI2131)
She took it with her wherever she went; she chose it. (SI2132)
Here they did not need to be in ghettos. (SI2133)
All his family was dead, except for his son. (SI2134)
You feel him every mile further away. (SI2135)
Each of us had his own specialty besides. (SI2136)
The eye is all, inward or outward. (SI2137)
Why should this suddenly assail her? (SI2138)
Then the telephoning began. (SI2139)
Was it a hysterical release from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks? (SI2140)
It was nobody's fault. (SI2141)
She overplayed her hand. (SI2142)
Why put such a high value on being top dog? (SI2143)
Why are you trying to worry me? (SI2144)
Was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance? (SI2145)
But it was a hopeful sign, he told himself. (SI2146)
When they got home at midnight she was tired out. (SI2147)
Look somewhere else. (SI2148)
Let's be fine superior people of great dignity, he said as if he were joking. (SI2149)
Then he fled, not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry. (SI2150)
He sank back, sighing, and was soon asleep again. (SI2151)
His fingers fumbled across the bandages. (SI2152)
He recognized his jacket and trousers. (SI2153)
She must have put his clothes in the closet. (SI2154)
He was kneeling to tie his shoelaces. (SI2155)
His fingers felt absurdly thick and clumsy. (SI2156)
Who would take over? (SI2157)
For a moment he felt like a thief discovered. (SI2158)
Her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight. (SI2159)
He had never felt particularly close to her. (SI2160)
Forget we ever knew what? (SI2161)
His voice seemed thick and purposeless. (SI2162)
Are you positive you'll be all right by yourself? (SI2163)
Take care of yourself then. (SI2164)
No, really, right as rain. (SI2165)
Look, sweetheart, some fool was. (SI2166)
A smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape. (SI2167)
They make us conformists look good. (SI2168)
Upstairs, busy feet, showering like raindrops, pattered around her room. (SI2169)
His dark brows, which had been lowered in anger, smoothed. (SI2170)
How long would it be occupied? (SI2171)
Strength began to zip up and down his chest. (SI2172)
He wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks. (SI2173)
Aw, shut up, he said. (SI2174)
Shivering, he put on his clothes. (SI2175)
Watch it, big shot, a hoarse voice yelled back. (SI2176)
She was holding on to his rock with one hand. (SI2177)
Her cough sounded like cloth ripping. (SI2178)
My mother never wops me. (SI2179)
She spouted a mouthful of water into the air. (SI2180)
Part collie, part wire-haired terrier. (SI2181)
Naturally curly hair runs in my family. (SI2182)
Books are for schnooks. (SI2183)
Either that or a veterinarian. (SI2184)
She said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward. (SI2185)
Her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough. (SI2186)
He daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around. (SI2187)
He says he'll be here on the one-o'clock plane. (SI2188)
You saw them always together those years. (SI2189)
Now you know she could've, but she isn't that kind of girl. (SI2190)
She didn't even give me a chance to refuse. (SI2191)
But now she looked ugly. (SI2192)
Now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough. (SI2193)
He had fallen into a soft job, and now the job was gone and he was stranded. (SI2194)
"Virus infection nothing!", she'd scream at him. (SI2195)
A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at. (SI2196)
The ward was a small one, four beds, kept reserved for female alcoholics. (SI2197)
But if she wasn't interested, she'd just go back to the same life she'd left. (SI2198)
Will you tell me why? (SI2199)
She went on, disregarding my protests. (SI2200)
Just let me die in peace. (SI2201)
A long, long way down. (SI2202)
The reasons for this dive seemed foolish now. (SI2203)
Pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick. (SI2204)
She saw me and sat down beside me, three feet away. (SI2205)
Not good looking, but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive. (SI2206)
As we ate, we talked. (SI2207)
Yes, because you didn't run off to use that new toothbrush. (SI2208)
A bullet, she answered. (SI2209)
No return address whatsoever. (SI2210)
He was full of heavy family reminiscence. (SI2211)
The rides were tame enough -- mostly we talked. (SI2212)
Somebody with no vices. (SI2213)
And never show my face or my truck around here again. (SI2214)
It was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced. (SI2215)
It's never wrong if love is real. (SI2216)
He'd not only told me so, he'd proved it. (SI2217)
No price is too high when true love is at stake. (SI2218)
Share bath, maybe -- but share refrigerator? (SI2219)
The red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound. (SI2220)
This is a sleeping capsule. (SI2221)
You young men get to be my age, you won't take flu so lightly. (SI2222)
In these damp circumstances, he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia. (SI2223)
Fine, day after tomorrow, she added. (SI2224)
Run-down, iron-poor. (SI2225)
But then, redheads are often pale. (SI2226)
You're having a miserable time, aren't you? (SI2227)
Suppose what's-his-name got a sunburn? (SI2228)
How's your sunburn now? (SI2229)
When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in. (SI2230)
They were both walking towards each other, unhurried. (SI2231)
Fights sprang up and were quickly squelched. (SI2232)
Why the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on me? (SI2233)
Nobody else did, either. (SI2234)
You don't belong in professional baseball. (SI2235)
Now don't tell me what a good ball player you are. (SI2236)
Baseball's no cinch. (SI2237)
His lips felt glued together. (SI2238)
The leagues are full of guys like that. (SI2239)
Why not try another club? (SI2240)
He needs outfielders bad. (SI2241)
Twenty-two or twenty-three. (SI2242)
Snakes are ugly, he said again. (SI2243)
Nobody likes snakes. (SI2244)
He could take the advice or leave it. (SI2245)
Real bright along those lines, you might say. (SI2246)
Weakness in leadership. (SI2247)
She always could sense the shag end of a woolly day. (SI2248)
Did you know he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale this weekend? (SI2249)
All your wishful thinking won't change that. (SI2250)
He had always been a messy and negligent man. (SI2251)
Half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things. (SI2252)
More, he could take at leisure. (SI2253)
Quietly he determined to foil her. (SI2254)
He swung around, eyes toward the bedroom, some fifteen feet away. (SI2255)
Suppose he ran up the white flag altogether? (SI2256)
But his resolution hardly seemed to help. (SI2257)
You were in a hurry, weren't you? (SI2258)
The tale, he thought, would become less gay. (SI2259)
Heavy industry, slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers, attracted him. (SI2260)
We're here to transact business. (SI2261)
We've all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age. (SI2262)
Nobody else showed pleasure. (SI2263)
Hello, boss, he said, and grinned. (SI2264)
That worm a murderer? (SI2265)
His manhood had been attacked. (SI2266)
Joking stopped and everyone gathered around. (SI2267)
Needless to say, my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period. (SI2268)
Could it do otherwise? (SI2269)
Dogs did something to one's ego. (SI2270)
Add things as you find you need 'em. (SI2271)
Perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget. (SI2272)
It all seemed rather hopeless. (SI2273)
No, he didn't know of any handyman-carpenter. (SI2274)
It all did look very efficient and shipshape. (SI2275)
One species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition. (SI2276)
Another stock vaudeville gag ran: mother is home sick in bed with the doctor. (SI2277)
View takes in five counties, two bedrooms. (SI2278)
Officials meet on rubbish. (SI2279)
Many shapes in bathtubs. (SI2280)
Samples: he walked in upon her invitation. (SI2281)
Not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese. (SI2282)
In news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs. (SI2283)
A woman met a famous author at a literary tea. (SI2284)
The girl nodded understandingly. (SI2285)
Yes, sir, she said, is that definite? (SI2286)
Of course, dear, she said. (SI2287)
Another brand of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double verb. (SI2288)
Finally he asked, do you object to petting? (SI2289)
Ambiguity arises when the pronoun "it" carries a twofold reference. (SI2290)
That is only partly non-nonsense, he began. (SI2291)
Is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal? (SI2292)
Those were especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest. (SI2293)
Just long enough to make you feel important. (SI2294)
Their curiosity went happily out of bounds. (SI2295)
Yes, ma'am, the children chorused heartily. (SI2296)
One could hear a very faint, ladylike sigh of relief. (SI2297)
As a result, he was persuaded out to dinner. (SI2298)
Sometimes, he coincided with my father's being at home. (SI2299)
My mother was beside herself with curiosity. (SI2300)
Very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such jokers. (SI2301)
Whosoever violates our rooftree, the legend states, can expect maximal sorrow. (SI2302)
In short, and to borrow an arboreal phrase, slash timber. (SI2303)
Now he's bought it, said my wife contentedly. (SI2304)
As you can count on me to do the same. (SI2305)
Yes, ma'am, it sure was. (SI2306)
I always say you've got a wonderful husband, Miss Margaret. (SI2307)
May I get some more cookies, Nora? (SI2308)
Well, wait until you finish what you've got, Davy. (SI2309)
And now Nora -- don't you encourage him! (SI2310)
Why Nora, the very idea! (SI2311)
Nora, I think you imagine it. (SI2312)
Well, Junior, didn't he eat only one and Mr. Henry didn't even do that well. (SI2313)
But everybody calls you "Junior"! (SI2314)
Junior, what on earth's the matter with you? (SI2315)
Davy Mathews! It's disgusting, the way you're always eating! (SI2316)
Well, I guess I ought to dust out that desk anyhow. (SI2317)
Don't they still call you "Junior", as though you're about ten years old? (SI2318)
Maybe they're delivering the desk now! (SI2319)
This is the second year your mother's donated my fishing tackle to the bazaar. (SI2320)
She didn't donate anything of yours, did she? (SI2321)
He told me so today, coming up on the train. (SI2322)
When we left Washington his son Tad was ill and Mrs. Lincoln hysterical. (SI2323)
Keep your seats, boys, I just want to put some finishing touches on this thing. (SI2324)
Then may I ask where these muddy foot prints came from? (SI2325)
Not very well behaved, is she, to run out on a play mate? (SI2326)
I'm sorry but I shall have to search this house. (SI2327)
Oh Mother, I saw them! (SI2328)
And Nathan, did he see them too? (SI2329)
I'm going to search this house. (SI2330)
Now if you'll pardon me, I won't keep him waiting. (SI2331)
I saw your horse outside. (SI2332)
You're to report back to headquarters at once. (SI2333)
But I'm so sunburned that every move I make is agony. (SI2334)
May I go and get Cassandra, Momma? (SI2335)
Well, there are other things to do right now. (SI2336)
Alice, I tell you my feet are like chopped beefsteak. (SI2337)
I've got to bathe my feet. (SI2338)
Gosh, the house does look like a morgue, though. (SI2339)
You'd think her stomach would've got used to it, in three weeks. (SI2340)
Yes, yes, we'll let you know. (SI2341)
Not when I was a kid! (SI2342)
